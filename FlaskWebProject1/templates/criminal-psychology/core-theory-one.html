    <h1>Social Learning Theory</h1>
    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <p>
        This theory says that all behaviour is learnt and that it begins with a <b>role model</b>; this is usually someone you
        look up to and respect.<br>
        Once someone finds a <b>role model</b>, they may go through a stage called <b>identification</b> in which they decide they want
        to be like the person they look up to and begin a process of <b>observation</b> and <b>imitation</b> to <b>internalise</b> their
        behaviour.<br>
        Once a behaviour is <b>internalised</b> it will soon become habitual meaning that people may engage in the behaviour
        regardless of the consequences.
        <h4>Why do people try to imitate their role models?</h4>
        It is to do with <b>vicarious reinforcement</b>; it describes what happens when we see others being rewarded for their behaviour decide
        we want the same rewards and that immitating their behaviour will get us them.<br>
        The behaviour is strengethened when we experience <b>direct reinforcememt</b> which is when the person imitating the behaviour
        recieves a similar reward.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Limitations</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>It ignores the role of <b>nature</b></li>
        <li>Doesn't explain how criminal behaviour started in the first place</li>
        <li>Dosen't explain why people turn to crime without criminal role models</li>
        <li>Dosen't explain why there is so much crime; if behaviour can be reinforced
        with rewards shouldn't it be reduced punishment? So why do people commit crimes
        dispite seeing the negative consequences?</li>
    </ol>
